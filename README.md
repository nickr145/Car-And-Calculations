# Car-And-Calculations

In the car class, there are 5 main methods that calculate:
1) The change in velocity
2) The net force of the car
3) The normal force of the car
4) The change in time
5) The distance travelled by the car, given the starting and final velocities of the car


All of these methods are void methods since they do not require an object to run. You can simply print out the result.

Change in Velocity = vf- - vi
Net Force = m * accel
Normal Force = m * 9.81
Change in Time = (vf - vi) / accel
Distance Travelled By Car = ((vf * vf) - (vi * vi)) / (2 * accel)
